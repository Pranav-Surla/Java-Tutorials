# Java Tutorials 🚀

Welcome to my Java Tutorials repository! This is a personal learning project where I document my journey as I learn and practice Java programming through small, hands-on projects and exercises.

## 📚 About

This repository contains simple Java programs and mini-projects that cover:

- Basic syntax and structure
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- File handling
- Exception handling
- Collections framework
- Java 8 features (Streams, Lambda)
- Basic DSA implementations

Each folder or file includes comments and notes to help you (and future me) understand the logic.



## ✅ Goals

- Solidify Java fundamentals
- Practice writing clean, readable code
- Build confidence in problem-solving using Java
- Prepare for real-world Java development and interviews

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Java (JDK 24)
- IDE : VSCode
- Git & GitHub for version control

## 🚧 In Progress

I'm actively updating this repo. Stay tuned for new topics and improvements!
